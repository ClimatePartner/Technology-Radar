It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.</br>
In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, just as any other data type can. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.</br>

While reviewing, the observer also considers the ""strategic"" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This is intended to free the driver to focus all of their attention on the ""tactical"" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.</br>

UI/BFF shared types,Trial,Techniques,TRUE,"In this technique, a single set of type definitions is used to define both the data objects returned by front-end queries and the data served to satisfy those queries by the back-end server. Ordinarily, we would be cautious about this practice because of the unnecessarily tight coupling it creates across process boundaries. However, many teams are finding that the benefits of this approach outweigh any risks of tight coupling. Since the BFF pattern works best when the same team owns both the UI code and the BFF, often storing both components in the same repository, the UI/BFF pair can be viewed as a single cohesive system.</br>

Kotlin,Assess,Programming Languages and Frameworks,TRUE,"is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web applications using React) or native code (via LLVM);</br>
